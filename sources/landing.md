# Andres Picazo GitHub page

This is the landing page for my github repositories. A small entry for each project is included here. For more detailed info about
each one please select the appropriate menu option.

Remember that this page is intended to be a reference for myself, since most projects already published here are meant to be reminders
and references about implementations, software usage and random tips I have found useful in the past.

# The projects
---
### Codex
Right now this is my most up to date reference project. I hope to keep here all the miscellaneus reference projects I actually use.
Currently this included java-spring, angularjs and nodejs projects. I have removed most of the projects I had on github, and will include
them here when I have refactored and updated them.

More specific links to:

* [Main repository](https://github.com/apycazo/codex).
* [Spring boot miscellaneus](https://github.com/apycazo/codex/tree/master/codex-spring/codex-spring-base)
* [Spring boot rest/MVC services](https://github.com/apycazo/codex/tree/master/codex-spring/codex-spring-rest)
* [Spring security](https://github.com/apycazo/codex/tree/master/codex-spring/codex-spring-security)
* [NodeJS](https://github.com/apycazo/codex/tree/master/codex-nodejs)
* [AngularJS](https://github.com/apycazo/codex/tree/master/codex-angularjs)

### Legacy
Most old code is now here, at least the code I did not want to get rid off right now. Whatever is useful will be refactored into `codex`
entries.

### Marksite
This is a very small project I did to quickly set up this page. I could have used jekyll or something, but since I did not have anything
really useful done with nodejs, and I wanted a few specific features on the page generation, I decided to go with a quick implementation of
a markdown to html site generator.

Right now it does just what I wanted it to do, if I find it worth the time, I will improve the code whenever I have the time.
